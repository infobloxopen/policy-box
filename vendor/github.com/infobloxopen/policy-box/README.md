# Policy Engine
Policy Engine (PE) is a set of tools for managing and enforcing security policies.

# Policy Language
PE introduces YAML based policy language similar to that defined by [XACML](http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/3.0/xacml-3.0-core-spec-os-en.html).

# PDP
Policy Decision Point is an entity that evaluates applicable policy and renders an authorization decision. PE provides PDP as a golang package.
